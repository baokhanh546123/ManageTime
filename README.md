# ManageTime
If you're busy managing your time on weekends, this app can help. Easily track tasks and set reminders for important deadlines with its user-friendly interface, making it simple to organize your schedule. 

I developed this app using PyQt5 and MySQL. 

First, download the zip file or clone the repository from https://github.com/baokhanh546123/ManageTime.git.  
Second, run quanli.sql.  
Third, install the necessary packages by executing "pip install -r requirements.txt".  
Fourth, update the user and password in the function.  
Finally, run the application in VS Code or CMD using "python QuanLiLichHoc.py".
